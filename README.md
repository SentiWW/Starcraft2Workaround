# Starcraft II Workaround
This program automates the workaround to a bug causing long wait time before starting Starcraft II.
The way it works:
1. It starts Starcraft II
2. It disables internet access (ipconfig /release) ¹
3. It reenables internet access (ipconfig /renew) ¹
4. The game starts normally but you have to log in ingame ²

¹ - Internet access is disabled for a short ammount of time

² - Still faster than waiting for the game to start normally with this bug

# How to use
1. Download the program
2. Extract it anywhere
3. Input the path to the folder containing the `Starcraft II.exe` (you will only have to do it once, it gets saved after that)
4. Click start, after this the game starts normally

# Is this safe to use?
Yes. This is a really simple program, mayby 50 lines long in total (excluding GUI). It also doesn't save any information about you and is fully offline.
